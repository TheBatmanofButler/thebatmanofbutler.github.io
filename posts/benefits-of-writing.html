        <p>
          Most of the time, writing is a chore for me. I want to try to change
          that because I think writing can be a useful tool to organize my
          thoughts and decisions more clearly.
        </p>

          It feels intimidating to write publicly because I feel compelled to
          write a lot, with great meaning. But I think that one of the best
          benefits of writing is that I can read what I wrote and trim it to
          have more precision. So maybe less is more.
